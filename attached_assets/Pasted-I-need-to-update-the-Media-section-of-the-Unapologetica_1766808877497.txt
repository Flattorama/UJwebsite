I need to update the "Media" section of the Unapologetically Jewish website with a new set of content. Please follow these instructions carefully to restructure the section and populate it with the data provided below.

1. Structural Changes
Segment the Media Section: Instead of a single list, divide the media section into three distinct sub-sections with their own headers:

"The Unapologetic Voice" (For Op-Eds and Manifestos authored by the founder).

"In The News" (For third-party press coverage and legal updates).

"Broadcast & Audio" (For radio interviews and podcasts).

Card Layout: Display the items in a responsive grid layout (cards).

Each card should include:

Eyebrow/Category: The Source Name (e.g., "National Post", "CTV News").

Date: Formatted as "Mon DD, YYYY" (e.g., "Nov 11, 2025").

Headline: Bold and prominent.

Summary: A short description (2-3 lines max).

CTA Button: A clear link button (e.g., "Read Article", "Watch Clip").

Video Embedding:

For the "Broadcast & Audio" section and specifically for the CPAC and YouTube links, please implement a video embed or a modal pop-up player so the user can watch directly on the page without leaving. If a direct embed isn't possible for a specific source, fall back to a "Watch Clip" link that opens in a new tab.

2. Content Data to Populate
